                Trivium is an American heavy metal band from Orlando, Florida, formed in 1999.
                After getting signed to Roadrunner Records in 2004, the band has released eight studio albums and over twenty singles. 
                Their latest album, The Sin and the Sentence, was released on October 20, 2017. 
                The band has sold over one million albums worldwide.
                    The band formed in 1999. At his eighth-grade talent show, Matt Heafy performed a cover version of "No Leaf Clover" by Metallica.
                Singer Brad Lewter noticed Heafy and later asked him to try out for his band as lead guitarist. 
                The pair went over to drummer Travis Smith's house where they played a rendition of Metallica's "For Whom the Bell Tolls". 
                Impressed with Heafy's performance, they accepted him into the band known as "Trivium",
                which is a Latin three-way intersection they used to explain their music as combining metalcore, melodic death metal and thrash metal.
                Lewter played a number of local gigs with the band before departing about a year later.
                In mid-2001 Trivium parted ways with its bassist. Trivium asked Richie Brown from local black metal band Mindscar to fill in on bass duties 
                until a full-time member could be brought in. A string of successful shows followed and then a search was conducted for a permanent bassist.
                    In late 2002, Trivium went into the recording studio to record its first high-quality demo disc.
                A copy of the demo was heard by German label Lifeforce which signed Trivium, and the band entered a studio to record its debut album, Ember to Inferno.
                Lead guitarist Corey Beaulieu joined after the recording of the album. In 2004, Paolo Gregoletto joined as the band's bassist, replacing Brent Young, before a tour with Machine Head.
                The album Ember to Inferno managed to garner the interest of Roadrunner Records representatives, who later signed Trivium to the label. The band then began writing songs for their major label debut.
